The tidal predictions are generated from harmonic or subordinate tide station/locations. Harmonic locations (also known as reference sites) are generated by regular water level reading sites. Subordinate locations predictions are derived by applying corrections to a reference tide station. This API uses the tide station IDs posted by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). <br /><br /> For more details please visit Documentation - https://goo.gl/KuhH6i.",
