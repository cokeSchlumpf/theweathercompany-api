Past weather observations, up to one month (31 days max) of archived weather observation data for the location and date or daterange requested. <br /><br /> <b>Limitation:</b><br /> Archived observation data varies significantly by station and location. The earliest date of data recorded is from January 1931, but not all months from this time forward are available. Observations per station within a 24 hour period varies due to station operation requirements (i.e. modified operating hours, number of observations recorded per hour, maintenance issues, etc).  <br /><br /> <b>Historical Observations Data and Their Limitations</b><br /> Historical observations are “archived” and originate from METAR and SYNOP observation stations/devices. Although there is archived observation data dating back to January 1931 from some METAR stations, the available historical data is not contiguous for all months in a given year, for every year, and for all locations. Please be aware that there is a large volume of historical records that can be retrieved. However there are gaps in which a “no data found” message will be displayed for a period. When observation data is provided, it is recommended that processing rules be applied to ensure the desired ordering of the observations (oldest to newest, newest to oldest) using the observation date/time element in the feed. Reporting stations report weather observations at different intervals. Some observations are reported hourly, some every 3 hours, every 6 hours, etc. Some stations do not report during nighttime hours. <br /><br /> Please Note that minimum and maximum temperature values are often null. The National Weather Service in the U.S. did not begin to provide these elements until recent years. <br /><br /> For more details please visit Documentation - https://goo.gl/auOfXL.",

Reporting stations report weather observations at different intervals. Some observations are reported hourly, some every 3 hours, every 6 hours, etc. Some stations do not report during nighttime hours. <br /><br /> Please Note that minimum and maximum temperature values are often null.
